## README

First and foremost, I wanted to state that I took your suggestion of not getting into the nitty gritty for this assignment. I myself have fallen victim of getting way too invested into projects and that causes distractions. For this assignment, I just wanted to look at something that I enjoy watching (and occasionally gamble on), American Football. I wanted to set out and grab data from Sports Reference to look at kicking data for the past five seasons.
I created 12 charts, and as some were frustrating to create, I still enjoyed the process of getting more comfortable with R. This language is incredibly powerful for sports data, and I honestly see myself experimenting with it in my own time. I have seen various neat applications from the sports data realm of heat-maps and shot charts. These outputs constitute a little more finesse than what I produced for this assignment, however. 
Having said that, I created 12 charts, 10 of those are just from two sections of code. The main point of all this is I wanted to see if kicking in the NFL is getting better overall, and honestly I think it is just from what I have witnessed. However, my opinion, is just an opinion and my outputs still really do not answer the question completely but it does offer a starting point to a bigger project if I deem it so. The primary basis for this conclusion is that 50+ yard FG attempts and makes have trended upward consistently since 2019. I know that is just five years, but I wanted to keep my data strictly since before COVID-19. 
My assessment is that kickers like Brandon Aubrey and Justin Tucker have given kickers across the league more confidence and/or pressure to attempt longer field goals. My data findings suggest that as well, considering Tucker (Ravens) and Aubrey (Cowboys) have been consistently keeping their respective teams high in the FGA metrics. Mainly, because these teams trust them so much. Like I stated, this trust and expectation to knock down routine 50+ yard FG is shifting the league to find more kickers that can do that consistently.
Notes: I had to delete my origianl repository because of sync and setup issuses, so I just started with a fresh one but recycled some files to this one.
